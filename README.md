## FAQs


#### **What is OpenHCI?**
OpenHCI is an upcoming open guide to introducing the body of Human-Computer Interaction knowledge to the beginners and aims to create a crowd-sourced collection of topics and examples pertaining to HCI.


#### **Who is creating this?**
OpenHCI is being created by Simran Singh at Mathscapes.


#### **What is Mathscapes?**
We are a small team aiming to become an independent research lab committed to advance in the field of algorithm design through mathematical research. Learn more at https://mathscapes.xyz.


#### **What is OpenHCI Graph Visualization and what is this feedback for?**
The graph visualization is the primary component of the OpenHCI project, essentially a 3d graph visual representing the universe of HCI. This feedback will help us evolve our initial/rough understanding of such a graph.


#### **Why should I contribute?**
OpenHCI intends to become an open-source repository and all the inputs collected during the feedback process to improve the graph and subsequently the OpenHCI webpage will be available to everyone, for free. As a token of appreciation, we will add your name to the list of our contributors. Please feel free to decline this feedback in any other case.


#### **How do I get started?**
Please start by visiting https://openhci.mathscapes.xyz and begin exploring the visualization by moving around and making more space by dragging nodes. It is expected to take about 30 minutes.

## In-Consideration & Open to feedback:

* How relationships between every level are justified 
* If children under each parent are oversimplified, they may have connections to other fields regardless
* Examples for every connecting edge between nodes / field of study
* Voting mechanism to state likeliness of truth
